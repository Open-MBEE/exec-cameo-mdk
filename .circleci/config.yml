    # Deployment
    # Your existing circle.yml file contains deployment steps.
    # The config translation tool does not support translating deployment steps
    # since deployment in CircleCI 2.0 are better handled through workflows.
    # See the documentation for more information https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/workflows/
    # Teardown
    #   If you break your build into multiple jobs with workflows, you will probably want to do the parts of this that are relevant in each
