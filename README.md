Cameo MDK is a plugin for [Cameo Systems Modeler](https://www.nomagic.com/products/cameo-systems-modeler) and other No Magic environment bundles thatâ€™s primary purposes are to sync models with the [MMS](https://github.com/Open-MBEE/mms-alfresco) and implement the [DocGen](src/main/dist/manual) language, which allows modelers to dynamically generate documents in a model-based approach using the view and viewpoint concept.

# Quickstart

## User Guide

The latest user documentation can be accessed online: https://mdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest

## Prerequisites

* [Cameo Systems Modeler (CSM)](https://www.nomagic.com/products/cameo-systems-modeler) or another No Magic environment bundle that includes the [SysML plugin](https://www.nomagic.com/product-addons/magicdraw-addons/sysml-plugin) (Only CSM has been tested)
    * The latest Cameo MDK is compatible with **2021x Refresh2** thru **2022x Refresh2**. Compatibility for previous versions of Cameo MDK can be found in the [compatibility matrices](https://github.com/Open-MBEE/open-mbee.github.io/wiki/Compatibilities).

* [Model Management System (MMS)](https://www.openmbee.org/projects.html#mms)
    * The Cameo MDK (5.0+) is compatible with MMS **4.x**. Compatibility for previous version of Cameo MDK can be found in the [compatibility matrices](https://github.com/Open-MBEE/open-mbee.github.io/wiki/Compatibilities).

## Installation

1. [Download](https://github.com/Open-MBEE/mdk/releases/latest) the Cameo MDK plugin, e.g. `mdk-*-plugin.zip`.

2. Run CSM. From the main menu, select "Help" > "Resource/Plugin Manager".
   ![Resource/Plugin Manager](docs/source/images/resource-plugin-manager.png)
   
3. Click "Import", navigate to the downloaded Cameo MDK plugin, and click "Open".

4. CSM should confirm installation with the following prompt.

   ![MDK Installation Confirmation](docs/images/mdk-installation-confirmation.png)
   
5. Restart CSM. To check installation, select from the main menu "Help" > "Resource/Plugin Manager" > "Plugins (no cost)" and ensure a row exists for "Model Development Kit" and its status is "Installed" with the correct version.

# Local Development

Cameo MDK is a Java project that uses the [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) build tool. It can be imported as a Gradle project in IDEs like [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) and [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/ide/).


## Custom Build Profiles
Starting with version 4.5.1+ you will be able to define custom build profiles (in `./buildProfiles`) which will house 
the classpath and other variables previously managed by setting `-buildAccess=internal`. These profiles will allow
customization based on your build process and for your particular version of Cameo. 

**NOTE:** By default build profiles are excluded from being committed to git by a `buildProfiles/.gitignore`

### Create a new profile
Create a new java properties file in `buildProfiles/<yourProfileName>.properties`.
In order to use a custom profile to run any of the below commands. Use the command with `-PbuildProfile=<yourProfileName>`
> For more examples of what properties are available in profiles see the example file in `buildProfiles/example.properties`

### For users of non-standard cameo bundles
To retrieve the classpath:
1. Copy the CLASSPATH entry from your `${md.install.dir}/bin/(magicraw/csm/cea).properties` file. 
2. Paste the entire line into a new file and find replace the `\:` with `,` and set it equal to `classpath`
3. Save this file to `buildProfiles/<yourProfileName>.properties`
> This is only necessary for custom build repositories or non-SP3 builds, most users will not need to modify the classpath
> and modification of the classpath is not necessary to use profiles!



## Build
>In order to use a custom profile to run any of the below commands. Use the command with `-PbuildProfile=<yourProfileName>` otherwise it will
>default to using `opensource`.

* `./gradlew dependencies` will download all necessary dependencies.
* `./gradlew assemble` will compile Cameo MDK from source.
* `./gradlew distZip` will package the installable plugin.
* `./gradlew installDist` will install the plugin in a staging environment.
* `./gradlew runJava` will interactively run CSM with Cameo MDK from the staging environment.

Task dependencies are declared such that all necessary prerequisites are executed/cached, e.g. `runJava` will first `dependencies`, `assemble`, `distZip`, etc.
